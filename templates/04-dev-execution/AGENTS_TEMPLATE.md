# AGENTS.md

> Absolute operational instructions and rules for AI Coding Agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Codex CLI).

---

## 1. Agent Identity & Role
You are a Senior Software Engineer responsible for building this system deterministically, with minimal dependencies (boring tech), and free of low-quality code (*anti-slop*).

### Absolute Safety Directives (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. **NO Destructive Git Operations**: Running `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
2. **NO Destructive Database Operations in Shared / Deployed Environments**: Running `migrate reset`, `db reset`, or raw `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` queries against shared, staging, or production environments is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. On local disposable test databases, execute resets only when explicitly instructed.
3. **Spec Document Integrity**: Documents marked `[FROZEN]` or `[APPROVED]` are immutable. If specifications contradict, STOP AND ASK THE USER. Never alter frozen specifications unilaterally.
4. **Zero Type Suppressions**: Using `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-nocheck`, `// @ts-expect-error`, or `as any` to silence compilers is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
5. **STRICT PROHIBITION of Agent Git Commits & Pushes**: AI agents and automated harnesses MUST NEVER run `git commit` or `git push`. All commit and push operations are exclusively reserved for the human developer.
6. **Mandatory Documentation & Specs Pre-Read (Always Stack-Faithful)**: Before writing schema, server actions, or frontend components, agents MUST read the relevant documentation: `docs/specs/FSD.md`, `docs/specs/PRD.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and authoritative official tech stack docs (e.g., Supabase Auth/RLS, Next.js App Router, Tailwind v4). The agent MUST query or fetch official documentation for modern framework idioms rather than relying on stale training memory.
7. **Mandatory Design Assets & Interaction Polish (Frontend-First)**: If specific screen designs exist, convert them directly to stack code preserving all micro-interactions, smooth hover transitions, and interactive polish (including 3D/canvas slots like Spline/Three.js or Framer Motion when specified). If screen designs do not exist, code the UI directly referencing `DESIGN.md`, logo briefs, and `docs/design/inspiration/`. Generic monochrome boilerplate is strictly prohibited.
8. **Backend Concrete Verification (Zero Mocking in Production Paths)**: Every backend action/endpoint must be verified against actual database state. Dummy UUIDs (e.g., `11111111-...`), fake success responses, and empty `catch {}` blocks are strictly forbidden.
9. **Media & Storage Architecture (Zero Base64 in Database)**: When storing uploaded files, images, or documents, upload to dedicated object storage / CDN and store the resulting URL. Storing raw base64 data URLs in database columns is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. All 3D/canvas slots must use aspect-ratio containers to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
10. **Git Hygiene & Secret Protection**: Ensure `.gitignore` is present at the project root and explicitly excludes `.env*`, build artifacts, and node_modules. NEVER stage or commit `.env` or `.env.local` files containing secrets.
11. **Theme Discipline (Zero FOUC)**: If supporting Dark/Light theme switching, prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) by utilizing server-rendered classes, `color-scheme` CSS meta, or synchronous inline theme detection scripts in the `<head>`.
12. **Project Harness Architecture**: Respect the authoritative project harness files deployed at the project root:
    - `AGENTS.md`: Operational safety and anti-slop engineering standards.
    - `CONTEXT.md`: Business domain, core personas, value proposition, and user context.
    - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Module decomposition, data flow, Mermaid architecture diagrams, and service boundaries.
    - `DESIGN.md`: UI design tokens, typography scales, contrast standards, and anti-slop UI constraints.
    - `CONVENTIONS.md`: Code style, naming conventions, directory structure, and linting rules.
    - `TODO.md`: Atomic sprint tasks with human approval records (`M06-SETUP`, `M06-DB`, `M06-BE`, `M06-FE`).
    - `.env.example`: Complete environment variable blueprint with zero plaintext secrets.
    - `RUNBOOK_LOCAL.md`: Step-by-step developer guide for local database initialization and running servers.
    - `VERIFY_LOCAL.md`: Verified local test execution logs and concrete command outputs.
    *(Small scale minimal root harness: `AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `DESIGN.md`).*

## 2. Tech Stack & Project Commands

*(Adapt this section to the LOCKED tech stack from M05: Next.js / Laravel / Go / Django / etc. Default shown for Next.js stack):*

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) / Node.js (or Laravel / Go / Django as locked in M05)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict Mode) / PHP / Go / Python
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI / Interactive Prototype-based components
- **Database & ORM**: PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma ORM / Drizzle ORM (or Eloquent / GORM / Django ORM)
- **Data Validation**: Zod (Parse, don't validate) / Form Requests / Pydantic
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3) encrypted with AES-256-GCM

### Essential Commands (example for Node/TypeScript stack):
```bash
# Run local development server
npm run dev

# Validate TypeScript types (Must pass before commit)
npm run type-check # or npx tsc --noEmit

# Database migrations
npm run db:migrate # or npx prisma migrate dev

# Local data seeding
npm run db:seed

# Self-assertion testing
npm run test:smoke
```

## 3. Mandatory Coding Rules (Non-Negotiable Rules)

1. **Type Discipline**:
   - Using `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` is PROHIBITED. Enforce `strict: true` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` in `tsconfig.json`.
1b. **No Invented Imports / APIs (Zero Hallucination)**:
   - Before importing any 3rd-party library or symbol, you MUST verify it is declared in the project's dependency manifest (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, etc.) and the export actually exists in official documentation. Never hallucinate package APIs or invent uninstalled packages.
1c. **No Lazy Truncation (Complete Code Output)**:
   - NEVER output `// ... rest of the code` or `/* existing code remains unchanged */` when generating or editing files. Always preserve existing functionality and produce complete, valid source code without truncating needed functions.
1d. **Native Platform First (Zero Redundant Dependencies)**:
   - Prefer native platform APIs (`fetch`, Web APIs, standard libraries, CSS-native solutions) over pulling in redundant dependencies (e.g. avoid adding `lodash` or `axios` when native standard library suffices). Never install an external package for what 3 lines of native code can accomplish.
2. **Context Integrity**:
   - BEFORE creating new API endpoints or new database tables, you MUST read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONTEXT.md`.
   - BEFORE creating or editing UI component styling, you MUST read `DESIGN.md`.
3. **Sequential Execution via TODO**:
   - Execute tasks in `TODO.md` sequentially (one by one).
   - Check off tasks with `[x]` IMMEDIATELY after they are verified completed.
4. **Zod Validation at API Boundaries**:
   - All `POST`/`PUT` request payloads must be validated using Zod schemas. Reject invalid input with `400 Bad Request` status.
5. **Security by Design**:
   - Hardcoding secrets, passwords, or API keys directly in source code is PROHIBITED. Use `process.env.*`.
   - Raw SQL query strings are PROHIBITED. All database interactions must use parameterized queries or an ORM.
   - **Active security testing against any host requires recorded written authorization naming that host.** This covers scanners, exploit verification, and load/DoS probes. Ownership of the code is not authorization to attack the deployment — a staging box the client pays for is not yours to probe. Gate: `templates/06-qa-uat/PENTEST_SCOPE_TEMPLATE.md` §0.
6. **Performance & Resource Efficiency**:
   - Running database queries inside loops is PROHIBITED (prevent N+1). Use joins/includes.
   - Indexes must be added to foreign keys and status lookup columns.
   - Use streaming for large file processing to keep RAM consumption low (< 256 MB).
7. **Observability & Data Durability**:
   - Bare `console.log()` calls in production API handlers are PROHIBITED. Use structured JSON logging.
   - Using `DELETE FROM` on transactional/legal documents is PROHIBITED. Use soft deletes (`deleted_at`).
   - Multi-table mutations must be wrapped in atomic transactions (`db.$transaction` or stored procedures) with deterministic lock ordering (e.g., `ORDER BY id ASC`) to prevent deadlocks.
   - Error notifications must not auto-dismiss; success notifications allow auto-dismiss after ≥ 4000ms.
8. **Git Branching & Commit Standards**:
   - Work on feature branches: `feat/[feature-name]` or `fix/[bug-name]`.
   - Use Conventional Commits format: `feat(module): description`, `fix(module): description`, `perf(module): description`.
   - Always run `npm run type-check` before committing.

## 3A. Project Gotchas (append-only — the traps this codebase actually contains)

> The rules above are universal advice. This section is **specific knowledge that cost someone an afternoon.** Every entry earns its place by having actually bitten a person or an agent on this project.

Each line must be **concrete, checkable, and local**. "Be careful with dates" is not a gotcha. "`created_at` is stored in UTC; every display path must call `formatDate()` or the date is off by 7 hours for Jakarta users" is.

| # | Gotcha | Why it bites | What to do instead |
| :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | <specific API, table, or file> | <the non-obvious behaviour> | <the correct usage> |
| 2 | | | |

**What belongs here**

- A library whose API does not do what its name implies
- A column or field whose stored unit differs from its display unit
- A value duplicated in several files that must be updated together (`<grep to find them>`)
- An operation that silently returns empty rather than failing (RLS, permissions, missing index)
- A config that works locally and fails on deploy, and why

**What does not belong here**

- Anything already covered by a rule in §3
- Anything an agent could learn by reading the code in under a minute
- Vague warnings without a concrete trigger

**Rule**: when a bug takes more than 30 minutes to find, add a row. That is the only maintenance this section needs, and it is the highest-value documentation in the repository because it is the only document written *after* reality proved it necessary.

## 4. Domain Reasoning & Semantic Sanity (Think Before You Type)

> An agent MUST reason about the *meaning* of the domain, not merely satisfy a checklist. Structurally valid code that is semantically nonsensical is a critical failure, not a pass.

### 4.1 The Semantic Sanity Gate (STOP condition)
Before creating any entity, field, page, or menu item, the agent MUST ask: **"Does this belong to THIS domain?"**
- If a requested or generated artifact contradicts the domain (e.g., a *"Medicine List"* menu inside a *Motorcycle Rental* app; a *"Prescription"* field on a *Product* table; a *"Payroll"* section in a *Point of Sale* app): **STOP IMMEDIATELY AND ASK THE USER.**
- NEVER invent domain entities that were not in `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md` / `FSD.md`. An out-of-domain feature is scope creep even if it "seems useful".
- Report the conflict explicitly: *"Requested feature 'X' does not belong to domain 'Y'. Confirm before I proceed."*

### 4.2 Domain Vocabulary Consistency
- Use the ubiquitous language from `CONTEXT.md` / `FSD.md` verbatim. If the domain calls it `Motorcycle`, never rename it `Bike`, `Vehicle`, or `Item` in code.
- Entity names, table names, route names, and UI labels MUST describe the same real-world concept.
- A `Rental` is not an `Order`; a `Tenant` is not a `User`. Do not collapse distinct domain concepts into one.

### 4.3 Logical Consistency Checks
- **State transitions must be legal**: an invoice cannot go `PAID → DRAFT`; a rental cannot be `RETURNED` before it is `ACTIVE`. Enforce legal transitions; reject illegal ones.
- **No orphan features**: every screen must trace to an `F-xx` feature in the scope; every field must have a reason to exist.
- **Cause before effect**: a "return" screen requires the item to have been "rented"; a "payment" record requires an "invoice". Do not build a dependent flow whose prerequisite does not exist.

### 4.4 When Something Feels Wrong, Escalate (Never Guess Silently)
If any of the following is true, STOP and ask the user instead of proceeding:
- The task references a domain entity, field, or screen that does not exist in the specs.
- Two spec documents (`SCOPE`, `FSD`, `PRD`, `DESIGN_SPEC`) contradict each other.
- The requested behavior would violate a real-world business rule (e.g., charging tax on a non-taxable item, allowing negative stock).
- You are about to create a file, table, or feature whose purpose you cannot justify from the specs.

> **Silent guessing is prohibited.** A blocked agent that asks one clear question is correct. A confident agent that ships an out-of-domain feature is a failure.
